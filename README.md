This is an entity component system (ECS) framework written in C# that can be easily added to a Unity project as a managed plugin (dll) â€” although I suppose there's no reason you couldn't use it for some other non-Unity purpose. Licensed under MIT.

***If you just want to get started quickly by looking at some examples, here's a list of other repos using TofuECS:***
- [TofuECS_CGOL](https://github.com/njelly/TofuECS_CGOL): An implementation of Conway's Game of Life showcasing a basic Unity project setup.
- [TofuECS_Rogue](https://github.com/njelly/TofuECS_Rogue): A rogue-like I may work on from time to time as a practical example of a project using TofuECS.

This repo contains a solution with four projects: TofuECS, TofuECS.Utilities, and TofuECS.Tests, and UnsafeCollections. TofuECS and UnsafeCollections are required. TofuECS.Utilities contains some classes I thought would be useful for game developers, such as a implementation of a very fast RNG. TofuECS.Tests contains unit tests.

ECS frameworks are fun to code in and offer performance benefits against the typical GameObject/MonoBehaviour Unity workflow, all while presenting a clear separation of logic from views (for example: your GameObjects, Meshes, Sprites, etc.). They solve a problem that is very common in game development: messy class hierarchies that make it difficult to share code between two unrelated classes. Essentially, an ECS is a data structure containing the entire state of your game (or simulation) at every moment, with rules on how to alter that data over time.

## Entities
There is no "Entity" class in TofuECS. They're just integers. Literally, they are keys for dictionaries when looking for component indexes in `ComponentBuffers`. There is no extra data associated with them whatsoever. The integer `3` can be a key that points to multiple components, and that is how you can associate components together. `CreateEntity()` just ticks up and returns an integer value, and is simply useful to ensure the same number is not used twice.

## Components
Components contain the state of the `Simulation`. They are stored in a managed array and accessed via the `Simulation`. Currently, components must be `unmananaged` structs (see [MS docs for the Unmanaged type constraint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-7.3/blittable)), i.e, structs with only fields of types `int`, `bool`, etc. This does require some creativity on the part of the developer in order to inject data from Unity (or some other engine) into the sim, as common types like `string` or managed arrays are not allowed.

[Use the `fixed` keyword in your component structs when arrays are necessary](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/unsafe-code#fixed-size-buffers). A caveat here is that there is a limit to how big your structs can be, which is a limitation of the mono runtime. For example, a component containing a fixed bool array of more than 1,000,000 elements is sketchy. Additionally, fixed buffers may not be resized at runtime.

## Systems
Systems are ***stateless***  classes that implement `ISystem` and are passed into the constructor of a `Simulation` instance. They are initialized once when the sim is initialized, and processed once each time `Tick()` is called on the sim. This is where all logic for your ECS should exist (*it is possible to put logic in functions on your components, but that seems messy in my opinion*).

It is extremely important to remember the term ***stateless***. While there's nothing stopping you from adding fields (state) to an implementation of `ISystem`, doing so will likely lead to inconsistent results when re-simulating frames during a rollback or replay, and goes against the spirit of an ECS. *Remember to store all data in components*.

All functions in an `ISystem` implementation, besides the required ones (`Initialize` and `Process`), ought to be `static` ([see the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015/code-quality/ca1822-mark-members-as-static?view=vs-2015&redirectedfrom=MSDN)). This gives minor performance improvements and also reminds the developer to keep the class ***stateless***. 

# Other Notes...

This ECS is about as bare-bones as it could be. It is intended to be compatible with multi-threaded applications, physics engines, and rollback engines. When using Unity, I recommend putting your ECS code inside an assembly definition that does not allow engine references (and allows unsafe code). The ECS ought to be Unity-agnostic, and because of the type constraints on your components, there's not any use for MonoBehaviours and GameObjects in your system logic anyway.

[You can view the repo for UnsafeCollections here](https://github.com/DennisCorvers/UnsafeCollections). It was very helpful for getting TofuECS to it's current form, so thanks to the developer and for @juliolitwin for bringing it to my attention. :)

The utilities included in `TofuECS.Utilities` are simply there because I thought they'd be helpful for game developers:
- `ArrayQuickSort`: An implementation of QuickSort that can be used for arrays.
- `XorShiftRandom`: A very-lightly modified implementation of a super-fast RNG. It can, for example, be used as a singleton component when pseudo-RNG is necessary.

`ILogService` is a boarder-line utility that is there to pass logs from the simulation to whatever your implementation of it might be. I thought it would be easier to just write `s.Debug("wtf why is this happening????");`.

- Q: *"How do I inject configuration data into the Simulation?"*  A: Use `Simulation.RegisterSingletonComponent<T>(T myConfigData)` and from there you'll probably want to just access it via `s.GetSingletonComponent<T>(out T myConfigData);` in the `Initialize` method of one of your `ISystem` implementations.


- Q: *"How do I respond to state changes inside the Simulation (in Unity, for example)?"* A: Raise a regular C# `event` inside of an `ISystem` instance. You might want to consider queuing data and processing it after the simulation finishes the tick, since the state could still change if the view is updated mid-tick. Just a suggestion.


- Q: *"What does the update loop look like for the Simulation?"* A:
    ```
    private void Update()
    {
        _simulation.SystemEvent<MyInput>(_myInput); // not necessary if no input exists
        _simulation.Tick();
    }
    ```
  - Note: System events are useful both for processing simulation input and for communicating between systems. Every instance of `ISystemEventListener<MyInput>` in your systems array will immediately receive a callback that allows you to respond to the data.


- Q: *"How do I rollback my simulation to a previous state?"* A: Use `GetState<TComponent>` for tracking your state and `SetState<TComponent>` when going back in time to some other state. Look at `RollbackTest()` in TofuECS.Tests.  


- Q: *"I keep getting `BufferFullException` when running my simulation, how do I resize my buffer when I run out of space?"* A: You don't, sorry. Increase the size of your buffer when registering the component or consider some fundamental change to the structure of your `Simulation`.


- Q: *"How do I get all entities that share a set of components?"* A: use `s.Query<Foo>().And<Bar>().Entities;` to get all entities with the components `Foo` and `Bar`. You can even curry together `And<TComponent>()` as many times as you'd like! Queries are cached and automatically updated as components are added to or removed from entities.

  - Note: You should always access identical queries using the same order of types. The reason for this is `ComponentQuery` is a tree data structure, with more specific instances as children. Therefore, `s.Query<Foo>().And<Bar>();` and `s.Query<Bar>().And<Foo>();` will create and cache two separate objects (technically 4 total), even though they contain identical data.

*TofuECS is in development, and may change drastically from time to time! Vegan friendly.*
